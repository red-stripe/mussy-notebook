- [x] Finally got around to deploying the live demo!

{% note All of the daily log entries live in the [`_posts/`](https://github.com/tlnagy/jekyll-lab-notebook/tree/master/demo/_posts) folder. There's a folder for each month. Each month-folder contains one file named `YYYY-MM-DD-XXXX.md` where `XXXX` is some arbitrary name. This was a compromise because having a single file for each day is annoying for looking back and forth and having to create new files all the time. Also having a single file per year leads to an unwieldy, monster markdown file.  %}

- You can also tag daily entries with project names like `#meta` or `#test2`. These project names cannot have spaces. You can see posts categorized according to these tags under [Projects](../../projects/). It looks something like this:

```
# 2018.02.21 #meta #test2
```

#### Section

- You can have sections and images

- You can use my plugin for Atom, [`atom-markdown-image-assistant`](https://github.com/tlnagy/atom-markdown-image-assistant) to quickly insert images into your lab notebook.

- You can also include nice formatted code:

```julia
f(x) = x + x^2

"""
This is a Julia function
"""
function g()
    result = 0
    for i in 1:1000
        result += f(i)
    end
    result
end
```
