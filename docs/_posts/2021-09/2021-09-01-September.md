# 2021.09.11  


Made up slants for the first time.
Also new PDA plates.


{% thought
More petri dishs and test tubes arrived this weekend. I'm hopeful that we might get a clean plate out of yesterdays lot of transfers, and can make up some slants as a backup before moving onto making grain spawn or liquid media.

Today's goal is to clean and prep the new glassware and document some of the protocols for the lab notebook.

`15mm Ø x 100mm slants with 7ml of PDA media`

{% thought

This was my first go at making up slants. I made them up after pouring all the agar plates first, so the PDA mix had stated to cool a bit. The last few didn't slant very nicely.  
In addition I'm a bit concerned that the small size of the test tube will make them challenging to work with during later processes.

Remade all of the previous plates and slants from 11/09, this time with the correct recipe. ㅇㅅㅇ)

{% thought
  So a couple of changes this cycle. We're now storing the petri dishes upside down in the incubator to try and reduce the condensation on the lid.
  You can see the change in growth pattern on TAA3 from when it was flipped.

  We also incubated all the new clean plates from 13/09. About two thirds were contaminated. So glad to find that before making transfers into them.

{% thought  
  Today we built a larger `Still air box` to try and make workflows a bit easier and reduce contamination.  
  Made up 300ml of PDA using the [PDA #2](#) recipe to fill 17 plates & 1 slant, probably only needed 250ml.
