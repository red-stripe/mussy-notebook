Notes:
Media was stored in the stable environment for the first 3 days. Before we noticed ambient temperature was too low (10C).
Moved to warmer enclosed environment for remaining duration (24C) but no significant growth occurred.
Some contamination present. Dishes also appeared to have high levels of condensations. Pictures below.
